# emoji-in-the-shell ⚔️

A (very) opinionated approach to add emojis into your command line

You need:

- zsh
- tmux
- fzf (it uses the fzf-tmux script)
- jq (for emoji generation. feel free to use your own libaray file though)

## Install

Clone this repo (don't forget about the submodules):

```
git clone https://github.com/chmanie/emoji-in-the-shell.git --recursive
```


Put 

```
source path_to_this_repo/emoji-in-the-shell.zsh
```

into your `.zshrc`.

No, I don't care about plugin managers. Go, figure it out yourself.

## Use

Press Ctrl-E in your zsh shell.
